This README will capture instructions to enable the team to make updates to the prototype repository hosted here (https://github.com/DepartmentOfHealth-htbhf/htbhf-prototype) and publish updates to heroku. For now, the instructions assume that the team is running OSX on mac machines.


### Pre-requisites for being able to pull and push prototype code from github

* You will need a working git installation (brew install git)
* You will need a Github account and account is part of https://github.com/DepartmentOfHealth-htbhf organisation (ask msmith@equalexperts.com)
* You will need a working SSH key registered with your Github account

### Pre-requisites for being able to push / pull changes to heroku
* It's useful to have latest version of xcode tools running on OSX (xcode-select --install) N.B. It's generally required that latest version of xcode should be running on latest version(s) of OSX, so it is good to make sure that you have latest version of OSC running
* You will need to install the heroku CLI (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) (brew install heroku/brew/heroku)
