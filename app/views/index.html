            <li>Added in ‘the age of’ to content for users where English is not their 1st language</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="apply-1-2/which-user">Who is applying</a></h4>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li> Simplified ‘I am pregnant, or am a parent or guardian with one or more children under the age of 4’ -  by splitting it into 2 questions rather than 1. Those where English is not their 1st language found this difficult to understand</li>
            <li>Changed language from ‘on behalf of’ to ‘for’ as it confused some users</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="apply-1-2/describe-yourself">Which of the following describes you</a></h4>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>This is a new question as described in point 2 of 'who is applying'. QUESTION: Should we keep the wording “Both of the above options” or spell out both the options (screenreader issue?)</li>
        </ul>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="apply-1-2/due-date">When is your baby due to be born</a></h4>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>This is now a conditional question if the user selects ‘I am pregnant’ which explicitly asks for the baby’s due date from ‘Which of the following describes you’. 1 user was confused by being asked this question after selecting a statement which already said she was pregnant on the first question.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="apply-1-2/manual-card-address">Delivery address</a></h4>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>The H1 has been changed to make it clearer that it is a delivery address we are asking for. All users missed this.</li>
          <li>TO BE DONE: Address labels have been changed as the word 'building' caused some confusion, as she wasn't sure if this meant the house number, in the end she left off the house number, as it wasn't actually specifically asking for that </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="apply-1-2/confirmation">Confirmation page</a></h4>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>The negative statements from the confirmation page such as ‘you have told us you are not pregnant’ etc have been removed. Users asked why we were showing them this information and felt it was unnecessary</li>
