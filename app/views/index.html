          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Added in ‘the age of’ to content for users where English is not their first language</li>
            <li>Removed messaging around receiving an instant decision to align with current dev API access.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="apply-1-2/which-user">Who is applying</a></h4>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li> Simplified ‘I am pregnant, or am a parent or guardian with one or more children under the age of 4’ -  by splitting it into 2 questions rather than 1. Those where English is not their 1st language found this difficult to understand</li>
            <li>Changed language from ‘on behalf of’ to ‘for’ as it confused some users</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="apply-1-2/describe-yourself">Which of the following best describes you</a></h4>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>This is a new question as described in point 2 of 'who is applying'.</li>
          <li>'Under 4' caused confusion in V1 testing as some users questioned if a 4-year old was still eligible. We are trying 'aged 3 or under' instead.</li>
          <li>Some users may be pregnant and have children, so we are testing a combined option for clarity.</li>
        </ul>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="apply-1-2/due-date">When is your baby due to be born</a></h4>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>This is now a conditional question if the user selects ‘I am pregnant’ which explicitly asks for the baby’s due date from ‘Which of the following describes you’. 1 user was confused by being asked this question after selecting a statement which already said she was pregnant on the first question.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="apply-1-2/manual-card-address">Delivery address</a></h4>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>The H1 has been changed to make it clearer that it is a delivery address we are asking for. All users missed this.</li>
          <li>Address labels have been changed as the word 'building' caused some confusion, as she wasn't sure if this meant the house number, in the end she left off the house number, as it wasn't actually specifically asking for that.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s"><a href="apply-1-2/confirmation">Confirmation page</a></h4>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>The negative statements from the confirmation page such as ‘you have told us you are not pregnant’ etc have been removed. Users asked why we were showing them this information and felt it was unnecessar.</li>
          <li>The H1 has been changed to emphasise this is the end of the application process.</li>
          <li>Numbered next steps have been added to increase user engagement. Few users read this page in V1 testing.</li>
          </ul>
