       What to update
      </h2>

      <p>Your help to buy healthy food entitlement (the amount of money you get each month) depends on a number of different things. That is why you must tell us when you:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>are pregnant</li>
        <li>give birth</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You do not need to let us know if your job or income changes. We will automatically be told this by other government departments.</p>

     <p>change address or contact details, move in with your partner, stop living with your partner??????</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
